# Overleaf {#overleaf .centeredslide}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Overleaf "is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents".
- All papers, outlines, milestone documents, and some of our documentation is written with Overleaf. Easily shareable and great for bookkeeping

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Overleaf!"}
- Learning LaTeX while your research expectations are lower is a good idea, trust me

## Overleaf: LaTeX {.centeredslide}
:::: {.columns}

- LATEX is a tool for typesetting professional-looking documents
- LaTeX works very differently: instead of a interactive page to type and edit text with, your document is a plain text file interspersed with LaTeX commands used to express the desired (typeset) results.
- To produce a visible, typeset document, your LaTeX file is processed by a piece of software called a TeX engine which uses the commands embedded in your text file to guide and control the typesetting process, converting the LaTeX commands and document text into a professionally typeset PDF file

::::

## Overleaf: Writing your first piece of LATEX

- Creating a document and writing some text 
  -
```{.latex filename="Document Creation" code-line-numbers="|1|2|3,4|5"}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```

  - Will produce the following image 
    - ![](https://i.gyazo.com/9b604fe70b5c218c6bc68df64525ed1a.png){width=75%}
  
- Not always this easy. Some journals/conferences require specific formats 


## Overleaf: Document Pre-amble
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}
- Everything in your .tex file appearing before \begin document is called the preamble, which acts as the document’s “setup” section.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex filename="Document Settings"}
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

```
:::

- In this example, we are setting both:
  - The font size to 12 pt
  - The paper size to letterpaper

::: 
::: {.column width="49%"}


- Overleaf is compatible with a bunch of different libraries, packages that you can use to your advantage. To do so, you'd want to include something like the following: 

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}


```{.latex filename="Package Import"}
\usepackage{graphicx}

```
:::

- For more info on what packages are available and their functionality, you can visit the following [page](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Finding_and_using_LaTeX_packages) 


::: 
::::

## Overleaf: Including title, author and date information 
:::: {.columns}

- Adding a title, author and date to our document requires three more lines in the preamble (not the main body of the document). Those lines are:

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```latex
\title{My first LaTeX document}: 
\author{Hubert Farnsworth}: 

\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}: 

\date{August 2022}: 
```
:::

::::

## Overleaf: Adding comments 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
To make a comment in LATEX, simply write a % symbol at the beginning of the line, as shown in the following code which uses the example above:
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex filename="Example Comment Line"}
% This line here is a comment. It will not be typeset in the document.

```
:::
::::

## Overleaf: Bold, italics and underlining 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
**Bold** : bold text in LaTeX is typeset using the \textbf{...} command.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}

```{.latex filename="Example of Bolding"}
Some of the \textbf{greatest}
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
Underline: to underline text use the \underline{...} command.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex filename="Example of Underlining"}
discoveries in \underline{science} 
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
*Italics* : italicised text is produced using the \textit{...} command.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex filename="Example of Italicizing"}
were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.
```
:::
::::

## Overleaf: Adding Images
:::: {.columns}

Overleaf supports three ways to insert images:

- Use the Insert Figure button, located on the editor toolbar, to insert an image into Visual Editor or Code Editor.
- Copy and paste an image into Visual Editor or Code Editor.
- Use Code Editor to write LaTeX code that inserts a graphic.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex code-line-numbers="|2,3|9-12|14"}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx} %LaTeX package to import graphics
\graphicspath{{images/}} %configuring the graphicx package
 
\begin{document}
The universe is immense and it seems to be homogeneous, 
on a large scale, everywhere we look.

% The \includegraphcs command is 
% provided (implemented) by the 
% graphicx package
\includegraphics{universe}  
 
There's a picture of a galaxy above (trust me yall).
\end{document}
```
:::
::::


## Overleaf: Captions, labels, references {.centeredslide}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out-out}
```{.latex code-line-numbers="|7,11|8|9|10|11|14"}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{images/}}
 
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{A nice plot.}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
 
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:mesh1}, the function grows near the origin. This example is on page \pageref{fig:mesh1}.

\end{document}
```
